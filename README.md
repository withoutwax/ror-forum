# Forum

This is a personal project which I decided to create a simple forum which users can register, write posts and comments, and interact with each other.

This web application is built as a personal side project to learn **Ruby on Rails**.

**Disclaimer** - Currently WIP.

Things you may want to cover:

* Ruby version

* System dependencies

* Configuration

* Database creation

* Database initialization

* How to run the test suite

* Services (job queues, cache servers, search engines, etc.)

* Deployment instructions

* ...
